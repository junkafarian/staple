Welcome to your {{project}} staple project!

There are some example templates in the `templates` folder:
    
    index.html      - Your home page
    master.layout   - a layout template (this will not be included in your published site)
    
You can publish this example site by running:
    
    $ staple publish --output={{project}}/site {{project}}/templates
    
This will create rendered html pages in the `site` directory.
